# ESP32 LED Brightness Control with OTA Firmware Updates

This project implements an LED brightness control system on an ESP32 microcontroller using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and integrates Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates. The LED brightness can be adjusted through a web interface, with real-time updates via WebSocket communication.

## Features

- **PWM-based LED Brightness Control**: Adjust the brightness of the LED using PWM on the ESP32.
- **Web Interface with Slider**: Control LED brightness through a user-friendly webpage with a slider.
- **Real-Time WebSocket Communication**: Send and receive brightness updates instantly between the web interface and ESP32.
- **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates**: Update the firmware remotely without needing a physical connection to the device.

## Components Used

- **ESP32** microcontroller
- **LED** for brightness control (connected to a PWM-capable pin)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Arduino IDE**: Ensure that you have installed the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- **ESP32 Board Manager**: Install the ESP32 board in the Arduino IDE. You can find instructions [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).
- **Libraries**:
  - `WiFi.h`
  - `ESPAsyncWebServer.h`
  - `ArduinoOTA.h`
  - `AsyncTCP.h`
  - `ESPAsyncWebSocket.h`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ESP32-LED-Brightness-OTA-Control.git
   ```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install any missing libraries using the Arduino Library Manager or add them manually.

### Usage

1. **Connect to WiFi**: Replace `YOUR_SSID` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` in the code with your WiFi credentials.
2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer and upload the code from the Arduino IDE.
   - Open Serial Monitor to verify WiFi connection and see the IP address assigned to the ESP32.
3. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open a web browser and enter the ESP32’s IP address to access the LED control interface.
   - Use the slider to adjust the brightness. Changes will be reflected in real-time through WebSocket.
4. **OTA Updates**:
   - After the first upload, subsequent updates can be done OTA via the Arduino IDE by selecting `Tools > Port > esp32` with the correct IP address.

### Code Explanation

- **PWM Control**: PWM is set up on the LED pin, allowing brightness control based on the slider's input value.
- **Web Server and WebSocket**:
  - A basic web server serves the HTML interface with a slider.
  - WebSocket communication enables real-time brightness adjustments between the ESP32 and the client.
- **OTA Setup**: Initializes OTA functionality, allowing firmware updates over WiFi without a physical connection.
